# All-in-One Module (AIOM)

AIOM is an integrated, flexible, configurable toolbox mainly built by Nodejs for customizing and deploying an online behavioral experiment. It provides a simple interface to build and manage your trials. 

## Description

**Why build AIOM?** 
- Customizing and deploying an online experiment can be really annoying! Previously, we use tools like JSpsych or Dallinger to code up an experiment, which either be intrinsically unsuitable for multi-task or takes a very long learning curve for people without prior experiences in Web development. To solve the problem, All-in-One Module was built for general, coding-friendly use. By using AIOM, researchers are able to design and deploy a local or online MCMCP experiment with just a few commands. Moreover, AIOM is open-sourced, which supports thorough customization for users with advanced programming skills and very specific need. Otherwise for most users, the basic templates and functions should be enough.

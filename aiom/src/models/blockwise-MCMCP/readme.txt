**What is MCMCP?** 
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) is a method for uncovering mental representations that exploits an equivalence between a model of human choice behavior and an element of an MCMC algorithm. The MCMCP method allows for the direct sampling from people/individuals' mental representations of a category or any other symbolic concepts, namely $p(x|c)$, $x$-samples, $c$-category. To illustrate, [which of a set of faces represents the emotion of happiness, or sadness, particularly at the individual level](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5hm49). Beyond this, MCMCP is generally a versatile add-on for a wide range of studies on human cognition where information of $p(x|c)$ is needed (e.g., categorization and concept learning).
